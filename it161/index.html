        <p>Welcome! My name is David Mathews and this is my first ever, trial run at launching my own webpage. I am currently taking IT 161 at Seattle Central College and in my second quarter of classes. And although it’s still early in the process, it is
            my hope that one day I will be able to put some of my newly acquired knowledge to good use with a career in the IT industry.
        </p>
        <p>Originally from Olympia, Washington, I moved to Seattle almost a year ago next month. In that time, I’ve had many ups and downs trying to get acclimated to a new environment, but ultimately its been a great experience and I’m happy with the decision
            I’ve made to come here!
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things I’m looking forward to this summer are backpacking in the Olympics, camping, playing guitar with friends, and possibly taking a road trip to Illinois to see family!
        </p>
