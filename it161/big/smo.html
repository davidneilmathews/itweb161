            <h2 class="subheader">Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
            <p>With nearly 4 billion social media users worldwide (Tankovska), all brands and businesses alike have little choice but to pay careful attention on how they use social media platforms to market themselves if they hope to be competitive moving
                forward. In essence, this is what’s referred to as social media optimization (SMO). By creating an effective strategy that engages your audience, the hope is that with increased visibility and sharing links organically, this will drive
                more traffic to your site, while also moving you up the hierarchy of search engine results. But how is this achieved? Is it not enough to just create a few profiles and sit back to watch things miraculously develop? The answer is, no.
                We actually have to take a far more proactive approach, continually monitoring and analyzing what improvements can be made to better meet the ever-changing trends in today’s society. As author Alex Uifalean points out in a 2019 blog, “According
                to research from AdWeek, 61% of consumers will unfollow brands because their content is no longer relevant and 20% will unfollow if the brand is sharing boring or repetitive content. Therefore, we need to measure our efforts and understand
                how well the content we share resonates with our target audience (Uifalean).”</p>
            <p>There are many tactics and strategies that should be included when trying to achieve an optimal social media presence. There are two ways that immediately come to mind when starting out. One of which is the use of videos. By using videos that
                are high-quality and relevant to what you’re marketing, we can tap into our user’s imagination and make the best use of their time. Longer videos are generally not advised. Instead, using shorter videos with better quality content seems
                to be the most effective. Visual content tends to catch the eye of the user as they sift through their regular feeds. Another highly recommended tip is to create a strong presence on Youtube. Granted, creating Youtube videos is very time
                consuming, but the fact that Youtube is owned by Google just increases your chances of being visible in their search engines. Lastly, knowing what, and how often to post on social media platforms is also very important. There are many
                different theories on how often you should post, but ultimately the important thing is that you stay consistent and know who your target audience is.</p>
