            <h2 class="subheader">Forms Research</h2>
            <p>Over 2.4 billion people are projected to buy products online in 2021 (Coppola). This means that more likely than not, each of these individuals will fill out a web form in the process of making their online purchase. As websites have grown
                to become more than just informational, businesses rely on their website for managing customer interactions. Web forms can be helpful ways to collect contact information for future product promotions or sales. Businesses can use a contact
                form to give customers a way to ask for assistance while removing the need to put their own email address on the website. Spammers have been known to scrape email addresses from websites and to inundate them with junk mail (Broadley).</p>
            <p>Generally, people aren’t thrilled about having to fill out contact forms. Whether they’re nervous about giving away personal information or pressed for time, customers won’t freely give their information away without some incentive. Businesses
                need to be conscious of getting just enough information for their use without overwhelming customers by asking too many questions. As Kristen Baker states in her blog, “If your web form doesn’t make sense to your leads —if it’s complicated
                or asks for too much information —potential leads may lose interest and leave your site. Consider how much the offer at the end of the form is worth and adjust your web form accordingly.(Baker)” Businesses should be intentional about what
                questions they ask, and try to keep the number of fields on the form to the bare minimum. For example, imagine a chain of bakeries. The bakery owners have all people who visit their website fill out a simple form that asks the visitor
                to fill their address before they can view the site. They ask this because they want to know where their customers are, so that they can customize the next page to show the closest bakery’s address and promotions. They could easily lose
                business, because many of their potential customers are unwilling to provide their address just to visit the site. Instead, the bakery website could ask for postal-code. Customers will be more willing to fill out their postal-code since
                it’s a single field and less-sensitive information. By keeping in mind what the business is offering the customer, and why they want the information in the first place, businesses can design web forms that are tailored based to their specific
                product and customer needs.</p>
